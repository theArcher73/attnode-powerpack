# AttNo.de-powerpack, a adapter-pcb to use 3.3-15V
 AddOn to use the [attnode](https://attno.de) v2/v3 with 3.3-15V DC

This small pcb allows to run the [attnode](https://attno.de) with an operating voltage between 3.3 and 15V.

It has the shape of the CR2032 battery clip and is soldered directly onto the [attnode](https://attno.de) instead of the clip.

Therefore, when ordering the pcb's, a smaller pcb thickness can be used if possible, I have had good experiences with 1.2mm.

The power supply can be either via the JST socket, or the two pads directly on the pcb. In this case, the JST socket must not be soldered.

The voltage source must provide at least 120 mA.
